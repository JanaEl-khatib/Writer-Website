                            The new Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesn’t drink or swear and has the appropriate
                            number of cardigans in her wardrobe.
                            With the darkness of her past behind her, she believes her freshman year at college is the
                            start of a new beginning. But then she meets Travis Maddox.

                            Lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, Eastern University’s Walking One-Night Stand is exactly
                            what Abby needs to avoid.
                            Intrigued by her resistance to his appeal, Travis tricks her with a simple bet. If he loses,
                            he must remain abstinent
                            for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in his apartment for the same amount of time.
                            Either way, Travis has no idea
                            that he has met his match in this “beautifully sexy, beautifully intense, and beautifully
                            perfect”

                            Cate Holloway knows the unspoken rule of New Orleans: avoid the powerful Gage crime family
                            at all costs.
                            Of course, that was before her brother got caught in their chaos. Now Cate has no choice but
                            to confront
                            the dark and forbidding prince of New Orleans himself and beg for her brother’s life.

                            But Lachlan Gage is as lethal as he is beautiful…and the only currency he’s interested in is
                            her soul.

                            Because Lachlan isn’t just some ruthless criminal. He’s fae. And he has his own secret
                            reasons for binding her to him.

                            Tricked and desperate, Cate is torn between humanity and the breathtaking Otherworld. A
                            place filled with
                            shadows and secrets, with members of each fae court plotting against her just as her
                            captor’s motives for
                            trapping her become more mysterious.

                            And if she can’t break this sinister bargain in the next thirty days, she’ll be bound to the
                            inscrutable
                            yet infuriatingly tempting fae prince and his deadly world…forever.

                            You must be strong enough to strike and strike and strike again without tiring.
                            The first lesson is to make yourself strong.
                            After the jaw-dropping revelation that Oak is the heir to Faerie, Jude must keep her brother
                            safe.
                            To do so, she has bound the wicked king, Cardan, to her, and made herself the power behind
                            the throne.
                            Navigating the constantly shifting political alliances of Faerie would be difficult enough
                            if Cardan were easy to control.
                            But he does everything in his power to humiliate and undermine her even as his fascination
                            with her remains undiminished.
                            When it becomes all too clear that someone close to Jude means to betray her, threatening
                            her own life and the lives of
                            everyone she loves, Jude must uncover the traitor and fight her own complicated feelings for
                            Cardan to maintain control
                            as a mortal in a Faerie world.

                            What if all the crushes you ever had found out how you felt about them…all at once?

                            Sixteen-year-old Lara Jean Song keeps her love letters in a hatbox her mother gave her.
                            They aren’t love letters that anyone else wrote for her; these are ones she’s written.
                            One for every boy she’s ever loved—five in all. When she writes, she pours out her heart
                            and soul and says all the things she would never say in real life, because her letters are
                            for her eyes only. Until the day her secret letters are mailed, and suddenly, Lara Jean’s
                            love life goes from imaginary to out of control.

                            He has a heart of ice...but for her, he'd burn the world.

                            Alex Volkov is a devil blessed with the face of an angel and cursed with a past he can't
                            escape.

                            Driven by a tragedy that has haunted him for most of his life, his ruthless pursuits for
                            success and vengeance leave little room for matters of the heart.

                            But when he's forced to look after his best friend's sister, he starts to feel something in
                            his chest:

                            A crack.
                            A melt.
                            A fire that could end his world as he knew it.

                            ***

                            Ava Chen is a free spirit trapped by nightmares of a childhood she can't remember.

                            But despite her broken past, she's never stopped seeing the beauty in the world...including
                            the heart beneath the icy exterior of a man she shouldn't want.

                            Her brother's best friend.
                            Her neighbor.
                            Her savior and her downfall.

                            Theirs is a love that was never supposed to happen-but when it does, it unleashes secrets
                            that could destroy them both...and everything they hold dear.
