                            The bride – The plus one – The best man – The wedding planner – The bridesmaid – The body

                            On an island off the coast of Ireland, guests gather to celebrate two people joining their
                            lives together as one. The groom: handsome and charming, a rising television star. The
                            bride: smart and ambitious, a magazine publisher. It’s a wedding for a magazine, or for a
                            celebrity: the designer dress, the remote location, the luxe party favors, the boutique
                            whiskey. The cell phone service may be spotty and the waves may be rough, but every detail
                            has been expertly planned and will be expertly executed.

                            But perfection is for plans, and people are all too human. As the champagne is popped and
                            the festivities begin, resentments and petty jealousies begin to mingle with the
                            reminiscences and well wishes. The groomsmen begin the drinking game from their school days.
                            The bridesmaid not-so-accidentally ruins her dress. The bride’s oldest (male) friend gives
                            an uncomfortably caring toast.

                            And then someone turns up dead. Who didn’t wish the happy couple well? And perhaps more
                            important, why?

                            When called upon, she can talk the death out of the dying and save their lives—only once,
                            never twice. But this truly unique gift comes at a price, rooting Weatherly to people who
                            only want her around when they need her and resent her unfamiliar ways when they don’t.

                            Weatherly’s cousin Adaire also has a gift: she’s a Scryer and can see the future reflected
                            back in dark surfaces. Right before she is killed in an accident, Adaire saw something
                            unnerving, and that’s why Weatherly believes she was murdered—never thinking for a moment
                            that it was an accident. But when Weatherly, for the first time, is unable to talk the death
                            out of the mayor’s son, the whole town suspects she is out for revenge, that she wouldn’t
                            save him.

                            With the help of clues Adaire left behind and her family’s Granny Witch recipe box,
                            Weatherly sets out to find the truth behind her cousin’s death, whatever it takes.

                            Imbued with magic, witchery, and suspense, Dana Elmendorf’s In the Hour of Crows is a
                            thrilling tale of friendship, identity, and love.

                            Avery Grambs has a plan for a better future: survive high school, win a scholarship, and get
                            out. But her fortunes change in an instant when billionaire Tobias Hawthorne dies and leaves
                            Avery virtually his entire fortune. The catch? Avery has no idea why—or even who Tobias
                            Hawthorne is.

                            To receive her inheritance, Avery must move into sprawling, secret passage-filled Hawthorne
                            House, where every room bears the old man's touch—and his love of puzzles, riddles, and
                            codes. Unfortunately for Avery, Hawthorne House is also occupied by the family that Tobias
                            Hawthorne just dispossessed. This includes the four Hawthorne grandsons: dangerous,
                            magnetic, brilliant boys who grew up with every expectation that one day, they would inherit
                            billions. Heir apparent Grayson Hawthorne is convinced that Avery must be a conwoman, and
                            he's determined to take her down. His brother, Jameson, views her as their grandfather's
                            last hurrah: a twisted riddle, a puzzle to be solved. Caught in a world of wealth and
                            privilege with danger around every turn, Avery will have to play the game herself just to
                            survive.

                            On Monday afternoon, five students at Bayview High walk into detention.

                            Bronwyn, the brain, is Yale-bound and never breaks a rule.
                            Addy, the beauty, is the picture-perfect homecoming princess.
                            Nate, the criminal, is already on probation for dealing.
                            Cooper, the athlete, is the all-star baseball pitcher.
                            And Simon, the outcast, is the creator of Bayview High’s notorious gossip app.

                            Only, Simon never makes it out of that classroom. Before the end of detention Simon's dead.
                            And according to investigators, his death wasn’t an accident. On Monday, he died. But on
                            Tuesday, he’d planned to post juicy reveals about all four of his high-profile classmates,
                            which makes all four of them suspects in his murder. Or are they the perfect patsies for a
                            killer who’s still on the loose?

                            Everyone has secrets, right? What really matters is how far you would go to protect them.

                            Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand
                            fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one
                            of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a
                            fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another
                            word.

                            Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into
                            something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into
                            notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from
                            the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.

                            Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to
                            work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she
                            shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the
                            truth that threatens to consume him....
