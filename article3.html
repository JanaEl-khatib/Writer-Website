                            Something is out there . . .

                            Something terrifying that must not be seen. One glimpse and a person is driven to deadly
                            violence. No one knows what it is or where it came from.

                            Five years after it began, a handful of scattered survivors remain, including Malorie and
                            her two young children. Living in an abandoned house near the river, she has dreamed of
                            fleeing to a place where they might be safe. Now, that the boy and girl are four, it is time
                            to go. But the journey ahead will be terrifying: twenty miles downriver in a
                            rowboat—blindfolded—with nothing to rely on but her wits and the children’s trained ears.
                            One wrong choice and they will die. And something is following them. But is it man, animal,
                            or monster?

                            Engulfed in darkness, surrounded by sounds both familiar and frightening, Malorie embarks on
                            a harrowing odyssey—a trip that takes her into an unseen world and back into the past, to
                            the companions who once saved her. Under the guidance of the stalwart Tom, a motely group of
                            strangers banded together against the unseen terror, creating order from the chaos. But when
                            supplies ran low, they were forced to venture outside—and confront the ultimate question: in
                            a world gone mad, who can really be trusted?

                            Interweaving past and present, Malerman’s breathtaking debut is a horrific and gripping
                            snapshot of a world unraveled that will have you racing to the final page.

                            Georgetown, Washington D.C. Actress and divorced mother Chris MacNeil starts to experience
                            'difficulties' with her usually sweet-natured eleven-year-old daughter Regan. The child
                            becomes afflicted by spasms, convulsions and unsettling amnesiac episodes; these abruptly
                            worsen into violent fits of appalling foul-mouthed curses, accompanied by physical mutation.
                            Medical science is baffled by Regan's plight and, in her increasing despair, Chris turns to
                            troubled priest and psychiatrist Damien Karras, who immediately recognises something
                            profoundly malevolent in Regan's distorted fetures and speech. On Karras's recommendation,
                            the Church summons Father Merrin, a specialist in the exorcism of demons . . .

                            A pulse-pounding, terrifying rollercoaster ride of a supernatural thriller—a remarkable
                            debut novel from a blazing talent that will keep readers spellbound

                            Sooner or later, the dead catch up. . . .

                            Judas Coyne was a collector. The bizarre, the unusual, the grotesque: A cookbook for
                            cannibals. A used hangman’s noose. A snuff film. Usually the objects were sent by the
                            black-clad fans who made his metal band a legend and made him rich.

                            But this time, when his personal assistant told him there was a ghost for sale on the
                            Internet, Jude didn’t think twice. But he should have. Of all the ghosts around him—the
                            abusive father, the battered, resentful child Jude once was, the bandmates he betrayed,
                            Anna, the suicidal girl he loved and dumped—this new one means to haunt him all the way to
                            hell.

                            His new acquisition—delivered to his doorstep in a black heart-shaped box—is Anna’s vengeful
                            stepdaddy. Martin Craddock swears he’s going to settle up with Jude for ruining his
                            daughter’s life. Craddock is everywhere: on the other side of the bedroom door; in Jude’s
                            restored vintage Mustang; outside his window, on his television screen. In his hand , a
                            gleaming razorblade swinging from a chain.

                            And now the jaded rock star who’s seen it all, done it all, has never been so afraid. . . .

                            A collection of tales to invade and paralyse the mind as the safe light of day is
                            infiltrated by the shadows of the night. As you listen, the clutching fingers of terror
                            brush lightly across the nape of the neck, reach round from behind to clutch and lock
                            themselves, white-knuckled, around the throat.

                            This is the horror of ordinary people and everyday objects that become strangely altered; a
                            world where nothing is ever quite what it seems, where the familiar and the friendly lure
                            and deceive. A world where madness and blind panic become the only reality.
