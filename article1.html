                            Feyre, Rhysand, and their friends are still busy rebuilding the Night Court and the vastly
                            altered world beyond, recovering from the war that changed everything. But Winter Solstice
                            is finally approaching, and with it, the joy of a hard-earned reprieve.
                            Yet even the festive atmosphere can't keep the shadows of the past from looming. As Feyre
                            navigates her first Winter Solstice as High Lady, her concern for those dearest to her
                            deepens. They have more wounds than she anticipated-scars that will have a far-reaching
                            impact on the future of their court. Bridging the events of A Court of Wings and Ruin with
                            the later books in the series, A Court of Frost and Starlight explores the far-reaching
                            effects of a devastating war and the fierce love between friends.

                            Long ago, humans betrayed dragons, stealing their magic and banishing them to a dying world.
                            Centuries later, their descendants worship dragons as gods. But the "gods" remember, and
                            they do not forgive.

                            Thief Arcady scrapes a living on the streets of Vatra. Desperate, Arcady steals a powerful
                            artifact from the bones of the Plaguebringer, the most hated person in Lumet history. Only
                            Arcady knows the artifact's magic holds the key to a new life among the nobles at court and
                            a chance for revenge.

                            The spell connects to Everen, the last male dragon foretold to save his kind, dragging him
                            through the Veil. Disguised as a human, Everen soon learns that to regain his true power and
                            form and fulfil his destiny, he only needs to convince one little thief to trust him enough
                            to bond completely--body, mind, and soulâ€”and then kill them.

                            Yet the closer the two become, the greater the risk both their worlds will shatter.

                            Elspeth needs a monster. The monster might be her.

                            Elspeth Spindle needs more than luck to stay safe in the eerie, mist-locked kingdom she
                            calls homeâ€”she needs a monster.
                            She calls him the Nightmare, an ancient, mercurial spirit trapped in her head. He protects
                            her. He keeps her secrets.

                            But nothing comes for free, especially magic.

                            When Elspeth meets a mysterious highwayman on the forest road, her life takes a drastic
                            turn. Thrust into a world of shadow
                            and deception, she joins a dangerous quest to cure the kingdom of the dark magic infecting
                            it. Except the highwayman just so
                            happens to be the Kingâ€™s own nephew, Captain of the Destriersâ€¦and guilty of high treason.

                            He and Elspeth have until Solstice to gather twelve Providence Cardsâ€”the keys to the cure.
                            But as the stakes heighten and their
                            undeniable attraction intensifies, Elspeth is forced to face her darkest secret yet: the
                            Nightmare is slowly, darkly, taking over her mind.
                            And she might not be able to stop him.

                        <p>
                            Deborah Harkness first introduced the world to Diana Bishop, an Oxford scholar and witch,
                            and vampire geneticist
                            Matthew de Clermont in A Discovery of Witches. Drawn to each other despite long-standing
                            taboos, these two otherworldly
                            beings found themselves at the center of a battle for a lost, enchanted manuscript known as
                            Ashmole 782. Since then,
                            they have fallen in love, traveled to Elizabethan England, dissolved the Covenant between
                            the three species, and
                            awoken the dark powers within Dianaâ€™s family line.

                            Now, Diana and Matthew receive a formal demand from the Congregation: They must test the
                            magic of their seven-year-old twins,
                            Pip and Rebecca. Concerned with their safety and desperate to avoid the same fate that led
                            her parents to spellbind her,
                            Diana decides to forge a different path for her familyâ€™s future and answers a message from a
                            great-aunt she never knew existed,
                            Gwyneth Proctor, whose invitation simply reads: Itâ€™s time you came home, Diana.

                            On the hallowed ground of Ravenswood, the Proctor family home, and under the tutelage of
                            Gwyneth, a talented witch grounded
                            in higher magic, a new era begins for Diana: a confrontation with her familyâ€™s dark past and
                            a reckoning for her own desire
                            for even greater powerâ€”if she can let go, finally, of her fear of wielding it.

                            In this stunning new novel, grand in scope, Deborah Harkness deepens the beloved world of
                            All Souls with powerful new magic
                            and long-hidden secrets, and the path Diana finds at Ravenswood leads to the most
                            consequential moments yet in this cherished series.

                            In the supernatural realms, there are creatures who belong to winter. I am not one of them.
                            But like the coyote I can become at will, I am adaptable.

                            My name is Mercy Thompson Hauptman, and my mate, Adam, is the werewolf who leads the
                            Columbia Basin Pack, the pack charged with keeping
                            the people who live and work in the Tri-Cities of Washington State safe. Itâ€™s a hard job,
                            and it doesnâ€™t leave much room for side quests.
                            Which is why when I needed to travel to Montana to help my brother, I intended to go by
                            myself.

                            But Iâ€™m not alone anymore.

                            Together, Adam and I find ourselves trapped with strangers in a lodge in the heart of the
                            wilderness, in the teeth of a storm of
                            legendary power, only to discover my brotherâ€™s issues are a tiny part of a problem much
                            bigger than we could have imagined. Arcane and
                            ancient magics are at work that could, unless we are very careful, bring about the end of
                            the world. . . .
